# Traffic Simulator Project

This project aims at creating a dynamic system for an efficient traffic management.

The first phase, as the name suggests, is the development of a traffic simulation environment, upon which we will build the upcoming 
intelligent traffic module(s).

So, the main purposes of this project in the near future are:
- create a simulator that includes:
  - single & multi lanes
  - overtaking
  - intersections
  - speed limits
  - semaphores
  - priority
- build a basic graphical output
- create a flexible design that facilitates envoroment variables tweaking
- find a formula to calculate system efficiency (based on drivers wait times)
